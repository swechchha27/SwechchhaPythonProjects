## List of my Python Projects
**1. OpenFoodFacts Data Analysis**

  - EXTRACTION: I have used sqlite db data available on OpenFoodFacts site. I just downloaded it and fetched its tables into pandas dataframes.

  - CLEANUP: I discarded a duplicate table, and also the rows that were in other languages except English. I am filtering data based on user input param Country.

  - NON-VISUAL ANALYSIS: Grouping by Product, I concatenated category tags, found out the top-level parent category based on all category tags for a product by utilizing a category hierarchy table.

  - WORDCLOUD VISUALIZATION: I dumped all product categories of user specified country into a list. And created a word cloud using wordcloud and matplotlib libraries.

  - ANALYSIS RESULT: Using the available data and the word cloud I created, I was able to analyse that for the Indian products available on the website, most of them are sugary sweet products.
